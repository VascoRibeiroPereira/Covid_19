# COVID 19 Amateur data analysis

This repo is intended for the observation of the COVID 19 evolution in Portugal and comparisson with other countries.

I'm a Data Science Student, so I'm in a learning process and every input will be very appreciated.

I'll keep this repo with the graphs daily updated.

The data source is from [Here](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide)
