# COVID 19 Amateur data analysis

This repo is intended for the observation of the COVID 19 evolution in Portugal and comparisson with other countries.

I'm a Data Science Student, so I'm in a learning process and every input will be very appreciated.

I'll keep this repo with the graphs daily updated.

### Files
`script.R` performs the data preparation and then followed by the steps required as described:

- Download of the data
- Subset the countries for more than 30 observations and make a plot of date vs death for each remaining country
- Filter and merges Portugal and China data from day 1 to present
- Plot the Day vs Death and Day vs New Cases for the China and Portugal data comparison

`PT_CN_merged_Graph.png` is the death comparison between China and Portugal

`PT_CN_merged_Graph_Cases.png` is the new cases comparison between China and Portugal

`subsetGraphs.png` is the death comparison for all countries with more than 30 observations of data

`subsetGraphsCases.png` is the new cases comparison for all countries with more than 30 observations of data
